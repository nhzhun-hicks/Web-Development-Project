            The other surgeons and the anesthesiologist disagree with your decision, and you explain to them that we've already used lots of supplies on the surgery and it would be a waste to dispose them and not use them.

            In your mind you tell yourself that the consequences of your actions will be big, but you think its better than wasting thousands of dollars on medical supplies
